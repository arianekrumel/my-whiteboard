**CS229 Machine Learning**

Week 1: Introduction
Machine Learning
* examples: database mining, self-customizing, autonomous applications
* computers learn without explicit programming/ learn from experience

Introduction to Supervised Learning
* "right answers" given
* regression - predict continuous value outputs
* classification - discrete value outputs

Introduction to Unsupervised Learning
* derive answers when don't know effect of variables.
* example algorithms: clustering, non-clustering (cocktail party)
